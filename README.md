# virtual-tryon

Virtual try-on app is a augmented reality based application which tries to create an illusion of a person wearing particular cloth. Due to recent pandemic people tend to avoid going to shops and prefer online shopping. It wouldn’t be feasible for clothing stores to sanitize the cloth every time a customer tries it on. There are several areas within the fashion industry itself, where this can be implemented, like Virtual Clothing Fittings, Make-up and hair color try-on, Shoes try-on, Optical glasses try-on, Tattoo try-on, to name a few.
Our research is focused on Virtual try-on for a clothing store. Our model augments the dress on to the person and show how it would look on them. User would stand in front of the phone or a ’smart mirror’ (if in store) and can browse through tons of collections in the store in a matter of few minutes and choose or filter the one that best suits the taste of the person.
